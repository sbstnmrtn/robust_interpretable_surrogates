# robust_interpretable_surrogates
Code and data generator for the paper "Towards Robust Interpretable Surrogates for Optimization" by Marc Goerigk, Michael Hartisch, and Sebastian Merten.

The code requires Gurobi to run.

shortest_path.py includes a graph generator to produce grid graphs as well as the seeds used for the experiments including shortest problems path presented in the paper.

scheduling.py includes an instance generator implemented according to Cohen, Postek, and Shtern (2023) as well as the seeds used for the experiments including scheduling problems presented in the paper.
